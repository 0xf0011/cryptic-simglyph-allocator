![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

**Brief Description:**  
Cryptic SimGlyph Allocator is a minimalist library for high-performance memory management when rendering and processing font glyphs in Python and C++. It supports lazy loading, vector aggregation, and GPU buffer optimization.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- **Memory Mapping**: intelligent streaming of glyphs directly into a texture buffer with zero-copy techniques.  
- **Glyph Packing**: advanced 2D bin-packing algorithms to maximize space in texture atlases.  
- **Lazy Loading**: loads only the glyphs you need at runtime, reducing RAM usage.  
- **Cross-Platform**: works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.  
- **C++ & Python API**: simple interface via `pybind11` for rapid prototyping and integration into game engines or UI frameworks.
